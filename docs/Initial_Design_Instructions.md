## this is the instruction for tomorrow's hackathon

Video Transcript

0:00-0:09: 36 hours. But for shopping. We'll give you the data, you design an algorithm, and I'll hand the winner 750 dollars and a paid internship with us.

0:09-0:15: I'm Aiden, founder of Clozyt. At Clozyt, we believe fashion discovery should be as addictive as TikTok or Instagram.

0:16-0:23: Powered by machine learning, embeddings, vector search, and real-time learning, when users swipe, they're discovering pieces they didn't even know existed.

0:23-0:41: Here's what we're looking for. Swipe right on a teal mini dress and instantly see more like it. Swipe left and your system should avoid pushing similar items. But there's a catch. This like shouldn't be permanent. Just like TikTok or Instagram, the algorithm should adapt without overreacting.

0:41-0:48: One bad swipe on a red dress doesn't necessarily mean it's gone forever. But if you constantly dislike it, the system should learn your broader style preference.

0:48-0:56: Your system needs to balance two things: exploitation, which is showing items similar to what they've already liked, and exploration, surface new, unexpected styles. That's what keeps the feed addictive.

0:56-1:15: We'll judge you on these five pillars. One, accuracy: Do the recommendations match the user's style? Two, adaptability: How fast does it learn from new swipes? Three, innovation: Creative use of signals. Four, preference balancing: Long-term style versus short-term swipes. And five, usability: Smooth, addictive swipe experience.

1:15-1:24: Do you think you have what it takes, Sun Devils? Prove it in just 36 hours. Join the Clozyt track and let's reinvent fashion forever.

and this is something they told about the dataset

So our dataset contains product catalogs of multiple clothing brands with around a 1000 products each. The dataset is gonna contain the item image, brand, price and a few more attributes about the style of the cloth, and it's upto you on how you futhur analyze the image to vectorize it and create embeddings and tags
