Your current implementation is not only on the right track, but it's also a powerful approach. Here's why:

The item_vector you're creating with CLIP is a rich, dense representation of the clothing item's image. It captures a vast
amount of information, including colors, shapes, textures, and styles. So, when you use this formula:

1 self.user*vector = (1 - self.learning_rate) * self.user*vector + self.learning_rate * direction \* item_vector

...you are, in fact, adjusting the user_vector based on all those factors you mentioned, like "white pants." If the user
likes an item, their vector moves closer to the vector of that item in the high-dimensional space that CLIP has created. If
they consistently like white pants, their user vector will drift towards the "white pants" region of that space.

In short, you don't need to manually add factors for color or style because the CLIP embedding already contains that
information. Your current approach is a solid foundation for a recommendation engine.

I noticed your image_to_vector function uses a hardcoded image path. Your next step will be to adapt this to process the
image_url from your ClothItem model for each item the user interacts with.

## Is the formula valid

That formula is a common way to update a user profile vector in recommendation systems based on interactions. It's a form of vector averaging with a learning rate.

Here's how it works:

user*vector: Represents the user's current preferences as a vector.
item_vector: Represents the item the user interacted with as a vector.
alpha: This is the learning rate. It controls how much the user_vector is influenced by the item_vector in each update. A higher alpha means the user's preferences will change more quickly based on recent interactions.
direction: This is 1 if the user liked the item and -1 if they disliked it. This determines whether the item_vector is added to or subtracted from the user_vector.
The formula (1 - alpha) * user*vector keeps a portion of the old user_vector, and alpha * direction \* item_vector adds a portion of the item_vector (positively for likes, negatively for dislikes). This effectively pulls the user_vector towards items the user likes and pushes it away from items they dislike.

Is this still valid with combined vectors?

Yes, this formula is still valid when you combine different types of vectors (like image, price, name, brand, etc.) into a single, larger item vector. As long as your item_vector is a numerical representation of the item (which it is when you concatenate different feature vectors), you can use this averaging approach to update the user_vector.

The key is that both your user_vector and item_vector must have the same dimension. When you create a combined item vector (e.g., the 863-dimensional vector with image, price, and multi-hot colors), your initial user_vector must also be initialized with that same dimension (as you did in cell 51e2e0ac).

This simple vector averaging method is a foundational concept in collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation systems. It allows the user's profile to evolve over time as they interact with more items.

--- with example

When a user likes a white short skirt, the item_vector for that skirt is used to update the user_vector. This item_vector contains components representing the skirt's features, including its image (visual features of a white short skirt), price, and the multi-hot encoded color vector (with a 1 in the "white" position).

By applying the update formula with liked=True:

updated_user_vector = (1 - alpha) _ current_user_vector + alpha _ item_vector

The user_vector is pulled towards the item_vector of the white short skirt. This means the dimensions in the user_vector corresponding to "white," "short skirt" (as captured by the image and potentially name/style text embeddings), and the item's price range will be strengthened.

When you then use this updated user_vector to query the Pinecone index, Pinecone will look for items whose vectors are closest to this new user_vector. Since the user_vector has been pulled towards the features of the white short skirt, the query will naturally return items that are similar in those aspects â€“ including other white skirts, other short skirts, and items within a similar price range.

So, yes, the part of the user vector responsible for querying more skirts with white and skirt-like features will effectively be "increased" or adjusted in a direction that makes it more similar to the vectors of white skirts. This is how the system learns the user's preferences and provides personalized recommendations.
