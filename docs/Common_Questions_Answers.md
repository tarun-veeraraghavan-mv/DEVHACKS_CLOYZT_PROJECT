Your current implementation is not only on the right track, but it's also a powerful approach. Here's why:

The item_vector you're creating with CLIP is a rich, dense representation of the clothing item's image. It captures a vast
amount of information, including colors, shapes, textures, and styles. So, when you use this formula:

1 self.user_vector = (1 - self.learning_rate) _ self.user_vector + self.learning_rate _ direction \* item_vector

...you are, in fact, adjusting the user_vector based on all those factors you mentioned, like "white pants." If the user
likes an item, their vector moves closer to the vector of that item in the high-dimensional space that CLIP has created. If
they consistently like white pants, their user vector will drift towards the "white pants" region of that space.

In short, you don't need to manually add factors for color or style because the CLIP embedding already contains that
information. Your current approach is a solid foundation for a recommendation engine.

I noticed your image_to_vector function uses a hardcoded image path. Your next step will be to adapt this to process the
image_url from your ClothItem model for each item the user interacts with.
